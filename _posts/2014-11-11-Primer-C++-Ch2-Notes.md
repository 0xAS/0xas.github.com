**Chapter 2: Variables and Basic Types**


- Primitive Built-in Types
    + Integral Types: arithmetic types representing integers, characters and boolean values.
        * a byte = 8 bits, a word = 4 bytes = 32 bits.
        * when the assigned value exceeds the range which a data type can hold, the compiler will let the assigned value modulo the max range value.
    + Floating-point Types: *float (32 bits), double (64 bits), long double (96 or 128 bits)*
- Literal Constants: 
    + Literal: we can only speak of it in terms of its value
    + Constant: it cannot be changed.
    + 3 ways of notations for *integral literals*: decimal, octal, or hexadecimal.
        * Suffix: by adding a suffix, we can force the type of a literal integer constant to be type *long (L)* or *unsigned (u)* or *unsigned long (UL)*.
    + *floating-point literals*: 2 ways of notations: decimal (L), or scientific (E, or e).
    + *Boolean and Character Literals*:
        * boolean: true, or false
        * character: '' + character.
